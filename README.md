Hopefully this will lead to something

Hello all!

  I am a disgruntled automotive technician who is looking for a better job. I have advanced experience in electrical and electronics diagnosis and serial data communication diagnosis. In addition I have skill in soldering and desoldering electronic components and PCBs. I have hobby experience in AVR programming(not just Arduino base controllers), C and C++, Node.js, HTML, and CSS.  Hopefully this will help me in my adventure.
